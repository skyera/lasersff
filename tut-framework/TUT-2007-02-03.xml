<p>
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 is supported. This version of compiler supports
standard C++ exception handling in accordance with the C++ standard. It means 
that only synchronous C++ exceptions thrown with a throw statement will be 
caught in a catch block. 
</p>
<p>
TUT uses two models of exception: handling SEH and standard C++ exception 
handling. TUT expects that if any structured exception is raised it will be 
handled by nearer C++ catch handler. It was default behavior of the previous
version of compiler (option /EHs). But for the new version I have to turn on
asynchronous exception handling (option /EHa).

<p>
Minors: Some polish work.

<p>
Note: I consider to stop maintain a lot of Makefiles due to lack of time and
support only Jamfile.
