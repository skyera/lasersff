Introduced new header include style. There are two ways you can include the TUT headers:
<pre>#include &lt;tut.h&gt;</pre>
or:
<pre>#include &lt;tut/tut.hpp&gt;</pre>
The second option is preferred method whereas the first option is to provide backward 
compatibility with clients of the previous releases.
